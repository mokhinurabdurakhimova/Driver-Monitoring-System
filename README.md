# Driver_Monitoring_System
The driver monitoring system, also known as driver attention monitor, is a vehicle safety system to assess the driver's alertness and warn the driver if needed and eventually apply the brakes. 
It was first introduced by Toyota in 2006 for its and Lexus latest models. It was first offered in Japan on the GS 450h. The system's functions co-operate with the pre-collision system (PCS).[1] The system uses infrared sensors to monitor driver attentiveness. Specifically, the driver monitoring system includes a CCD camera placed on the steering column which tracks the face,[2] via infrared LED detectors.[3] If the driver is not paying attention to the road ahead and a dangerous situation is detected, the system will warn the driver by flashing lights, warning sounds. If no action is taken, the vehicle will apply the brakes (a warning alarm will sound followed by a brief automatic application of the braking system). This system is said to be the first of its kind.[2]

In 2008, the Toyota Crown system went further and can detect if the driver is becoming sleepy by monitoring the eyelids.[4][5]

In 2017, Cadillac released their Super Cruise system. Which allowed hands free driving at highway speeds on specially mapped highways. In order to ensure that the driver continued to pay attention to the road, they included Seeing Machines DMS, this was initially only available in the CT6.[6]

In 2019, BMW introduced a Extended Traffic Jam Assistant System [7] in almost its entire range of car models this allows driving at up to 37 mph
